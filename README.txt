README

Launching code.
1. Open project in IntelliJ
2. Run Main.java (or the main in Main.java)
3. A window should pop out.
    a. All actions are performed in the window.
    b. Useful information for debugging/what-is-going-on is printed in the terminal.

Features present, but still in development.
1. Undo and redo buttons.  If visible, do not click.
2. Any buttons concerning loading/changing schedule.  Do not manually change schedules.
    Currently, each user is only granted one schedule per semester, which is updated by
    changing the semester via the drop down at the top of usable pages.
3. The Course Directory.  No point in navigating to this page.
4. Course info.  This works, but limited information is displayed.
